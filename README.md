# **Type-Safe Generic Linked List in C**  

This project implements a **type-safe, generic doubly linked list in C** using macros to generate specialized list structures and functions for different data types. Unlike traditional **`void*`-based generic lists**, this approach ensures **strong type safety** while maintaining flexibility.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ” **Type Safety** â€“ Prevents type mismatches by generating unique list types for each data type.  
âœ” **Automatic Function Generation** â€“ Macros create optimized list operations (`LPush`, `RPush`, `LPop`, `RPop`, `At`).  
âœ” **Efficient Memory Management** â€“ Supports custom deallocation functions for pointer-based elements.  
âœ” **Bidirectional Traversal** â€“ Doubly linked list structure enables fast access from both ends.  
âœ” **Optimized Indexing** â€“ Smart selection of forward or backward traversal for `At()` lookup.  

## **Why This Approach?**  
- **Avoids `void*` pitfalls** â€“ No need for manual type casting when accessing values.  
- **More readable and maintainable** â€“ Each list has well-defined operations for its type.  
- **Better performance** â€“ No runtime type checks; everything is resolved at compile time.  

## **Example Usage**  
```c
DefineLinkedList(int);  // Generates int-specific list

int main() {
    list_int_t myList = CreateList_int();
    myList.LPush(&myList, 42);
    int *value = myList.At(&myList, 0);
    printf("Value: %d\n", *value);  // Output: 42
}
```

Would you like me to refine any part of this? ðŸš€ (hehe :v)
